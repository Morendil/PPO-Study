Study Design
==========

## Motivation

There is a widespread perception that the Agile community is uninterested in empirical data about the benefits of Agile practices. (E.g. Constantine 2010) The background to the Project Studies Program is an article by Pask Award recipient Laurent Bossavit (Bossavit 2010) calling for longitudinal studies of projects using any subset of Agile practices.

The Project-Practice-Outcome Database is an empirical study of Agile practice adoption and of the contribution of Agile practices and skills to project outcomes.

Because collecting such data is a costly and time-consuming effort, Agile experts working in industry have typically relied on voluntary surveys, typically distributed over the Web and mailing lists. These surveys yield useful information, over time, on which practices are viewed favorably or with interest, relative to each other. 

However such surveys are not reliable information on how widespread actual usage of these practices is, or whether and to what extent these practices are of benefit to the project teams using them. Survey data is subject to two important biases: selection biases, where for instance only respondents already convinced of the benefits of Agile elect to fill out a survey; and hindsight biases, where respondents may attribute their successes to their favorite practices, even in the absence of an empirically demonstrable benefit of that practice.

## Scope

The scope of this study is restricted to projects which adopt one or more Agile practices with the intention of improving project outcomes. By "adopt" we mean an intention, a decision made in the knowledge that the practice is consistent with an overall approach identified as "Agile" (or possibly Scrum, Lean/Agile, Extreme Programming, or any other such widely acknowledge to be part of the Agile family of project strategies).

As participation in the study is voluntary, we can not expect that projects participating in the study will be representative of the industry as a whole. We intend to mitigate sampling bias by including a diverse set of projects in this study.

We address hindsight bias by studying projects from inception or as close to inception as allowed by the inevitable fuzziness around the term "project", and repeating data collection interviews at least two times over the project's duration and after the initial interview.

## Goals

The questions this study aims to answer are the following:

* which practices are viewed as a means to achieve which outcomes?
* which intended practices prove easy or hard to in fact adopt?
* how are project outcomes affected by practices in fact adopted?

## Data collection

We base the study on the Institut Agile's comprehensive list of Agile practices, a broader set than used in the major Web surveys.

A preliminary Web survey will be used to validate familiarity of the intended population with these practices, and to reach out to candidate projects.

A structured interview using the Initial Questionnaire will be used to collect contact, "sociological", technical and objectives information about the project. The Initial Questionnaire is in part inspired by (Williams 2004) in collecting "sociological", "project-specific", "ergonomic" and "geographic" factors characterizing the project, with the intent of allowing data from this study to be meaningfully compared with other studies of Agile projects.

Follow-up interviews will track changes and updates to any project parameters: team composition, technology, outcomes sought, practices used.

## Outcome information

The study is agnostic about what outcomes matter for a software development project.

In keeping with a tradition in the industry, we use the term "project" loosely to refer to any substantial investment of time or money in an initiative where the provision of software plays a major role. We acknowledge, however, that all formal definitions of the term "project" are flawed and may fail to capture aspects of such an initiative that are important to the people participating in it or sponsoring it.

We leave it to participants in the study to disclose which outcomes are considered important (and by whom), and to define the means of measuring attainment of these outcomes. The study will record those means and the resulting measurements both for "baseline" performance (i.e. in comparable projects prior to the adoption of Agile practices) and for the projects in the study.

(If no objective measurements are being collected by sponsoring organizations, that is in and of itself interesting information about these organizations, and we are unwilling to exclude projects from consideration solely on grounds of subjective assessment of outcomes. For instance, an organization may place "client satisfaction" as its highest priority, and assess this on purely subjective grounds.)
